				"Name":"Johny Valentine",
				"Year":1975,
				"BodyPart":"Back",
				"Details":"In 1975, there was an infamous plane crash involving Valentine and several other wrestlers, including a 24-year old phenom named Ric Flair. Valentine’s back was broken in the crash, and the injury forced him to retire from wrestling. Flair also suffered a broken back in the crash, and was told he’d never wrestle again, but managed a miraculous recovery and went on to become one of the biggest stars in the history of wrestling. However, the story takes an interesting twist, as it turned out that Flair and Valentine had switched seats during the flight, and while there’s no way to say for sure, it’s an interesting thought that if they had not, we might have been denied the entire wrestling career of Ric Flair.",

After running through a bunch of options, Foley settled on the craziest and most dangerous idea: start the match on top of the cage and let Undertaker throw him off. The rest, as they say, is history.",
